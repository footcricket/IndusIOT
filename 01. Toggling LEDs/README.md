# LED Toggling Experiment

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how LEDs can be used in application development.

## Description

In this experiment, LEDs are connected to the port pins PB1 and PB2 of the INDUS board's microcontroller. The code provided allows you to continuously toggle the LEDs with a certain software delay.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Run the program to observe LED toggling.
