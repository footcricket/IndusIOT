# LED Blinking Pattern Control through UART

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how LEDs' blinking patterns can be controlled through UART communication in application development.

## Description

In this experiment, LEDs are connected to the port pins PB1 and PB2 of the INDUS board's microcontroller. UART communication is configured with the required baud rate. Users can send commands (0, 1, 2, 3) through UART to observe different LED blinking patterns.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your UART terminal to communicate with the board.
5. Send the following commands to control LED patterns:
   - `0` - Turn off LEDs
   - `1` - Blink LED 1
   - `2` - Blink LED 2
   - `3` - Alternate LED blinking
