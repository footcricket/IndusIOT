# LED Blinking using User Button

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how a USER button can be used in application development to control LED blinking.

## Description

In this experiment, LEDs are connected to the port pins PB1 and PB2 of the INDUS board's microcontroller. We will toggle the onboard LEDs through user buttons, SW1 and SW2, configured in polling and interrupt mode.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your user buttons, SW1 and SW2, to control the LEDs:
   - In polling mode: Press the buttons to toggle LEDs.
   - In interrupt mode: Configure the buttons to trigger LED control events.
