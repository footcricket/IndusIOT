# Receive and Print Data on UART Terminal using Interrupts

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how UART, in interrupt mode, can be used to display data received from HyperTerminal on the INDUS (IDE) terminal in application development.

## Description

In this experiment, the user inputs a string through HyperTerminal, which is received character by character in the UART buffer. The received data is then displayed on the INDUS (IDE) terminal using interrupt-driven UART communication. This experiment demonstrates how to set up UART communication to receive and display data using interrupts.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your terminal software (e.g., HyperTerminal) to communicate with the board using the same baud rate.
5. Type a string in your terminal, and the board will receive and print the data character by character on the INDUS (IDE) terminal using interrupts.
