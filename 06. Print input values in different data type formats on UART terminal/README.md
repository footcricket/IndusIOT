# Print Input Values in Different Data Type Formats on UART Terminal

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how UART can be used to display input values in different data type formats on HyperTerminal in application development.

## Description

In this experiment, input values are printed in different data type formats, including integer, hexadecimal, octal, float, and string. UART1 is used to communicate between the user PC and the INDUS board, with the baud rate set as required. This experiment demonstrates how to format and print data in various formats on the UART terminal.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your terminal software (e.g., HyperTerminal) to communicate with the board using the same baud rate.
5. Run the experiment and input values to see them printed in various data type formats on the UART terminal.
