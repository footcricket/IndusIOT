# Demonstrate PRINTF Functionality using UART

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to understand how a `printf()` function can be used to display data on HyperTerminal through UART communication in application development.

## Description

In this experiment, a string is written into the UART buffer character by character and displayed on the INDUS (IDE) terminal. The string or data to be written can be easily printed using the `printf()` function. UART1 is used to communicate between the user PC and the INDUS board, with the baud rate set as required. This experiment demonstrates the functionality of the `printf()` function in displaying data through UART.


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your terminal software (e.g., HyperTerminal) to communicate with the board using the same baud rate.
5. Run the experiment to see the string or data written using the `printf()` function displayed on the UART terminal.
