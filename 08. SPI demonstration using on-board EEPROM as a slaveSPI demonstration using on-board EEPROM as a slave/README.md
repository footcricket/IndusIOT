# SPI Demonstration using On-Board EEPROM as a Slave

## Goal of Experiment

The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate how to read and write data from or to the memory array of the on-board EEPROM using the SPI communication protocol.

## Description

In this experiment, you will read and write data from or to the selected memory address of the on-board EEPROM. This data can be a character, string, or any numeric data. The data that is read or written can be displayed on the HyperTerminal using UART for validation. UART1 is used to communicate between the user PC and the INDUS board, with the baud rate set as required. This experiment demonstrates the use of SPI to interact with the on-board EEPROM and UART for data validation.


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment.
3. Build and upload the code to your INDUS board's microcontroller.
4. Configure your terminal software (e.g., HyperTerminal) to communicate with the board using the same baud rate.
5. Run the experiment to read and write data from or to the on-board EEPROM using SPI. You can use UART to validate the data.
